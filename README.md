### LAB: INTRO TO PROCEDURAL GENERATION ("PROC GEN")
- FORK the repo to your account, then CLONE your fork to your laptop (copy the ".git" URL from the green button, and then use "Clone" in GitKraken)
- open the project folder in Unity, open `Assets/Scenes/VlambeerLabScene.unity`, and then open `Assets/Scripts/FloorMaker.cs`... read the instructions
- you will be making something kind of like [what Vlambeer did for "Nuclear Throne"](https://indienova.com/u/root/blogread/1766)
